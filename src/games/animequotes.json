My commitment to find you comes with great suffering. Not once have I thought it\u2019s easy. For your sake, I laughed, cried, and yelled. Because of you, I destroyed my heart, my body, and the world. Still, I\u2019m only really alive when I\u2019m touching the fragment of you that I carry within me. Even if I don\u2019t reach you in the end\u2026 Even if I know the horrible outcome that awaits me\u2026 I will keep searching for you, who dwells inside Maria. I\u2019m going to vanish. Maybe I\u2019m getting my just deserts for being too greedy with my wish. To be honest, part of me regrets that we met, but if I were to choose between a life in which we met and a life in which we didn\u2019t, I would always pick the former. Always. I\u2019m sure of that, even though I may be hesitating over, wavering about, and regretting my choices all the time. I will not have accomplished anything by the time I vanish, and I\u2019m certainly not mature enough to say that I can accept that.

A really bothersome NEET vampire who fought to protect a human he had just met too! I've seen a lot more than just their bad sides. They're all my comrades. You know, it'd be good if you just talked about what's bothering you too. Neither humans nor vampires need reasons to want to protect or save something. If they find C3 is weakening, the balance between humans and non-humans will collapse. If we suffer major damage from Tsubaki's side and asked you all for help, can you guarantee that none of the other vampires would attack C3?

I could analyze the mentality of the actions that were grounded on these abundant, repulsive emotions. That's because I had plenty of those ugly feelings inside of me. That's why it was simple to imagine. if they were similar things, then there was still room to understand it. I could explain using logic.\r\n\r\nHowever, if there wasn't, then it was difficult.\r\n\r\nWithout the concept of profit and loss, it was hard to imagine the feelings of people who went beyond people who went beyond logic and theory. I had too little to go on and above all else. I had committed too many mistakes up until now.\r\n\r\nGood will, friendship, or even love; they were all things I had been mistaken with. I was sure that I was mistaken with them even now as I thought about them.",

Although we can\u2019t fly through the skies all alone, if we can think it, we can do almost anything. We can sleep when we\u2019re sleepy. We are free to start or stop anything whenever we wish. Of course, it is a bit hindered by common sense, moralities, and the rules of society. Walking nude out in the streets, stealing from the elderly, and even killing, we can do all of this as long as we throw out our morals. Which is why they drill these laws in our head when we are children. And yet, people still continue to fight, deceive, and steal from each other. And so, people suffer because they live. Even now, there are events of happiness and unhappiness going on all over the world. \u2026What can we do to make everyone happy? Of course that\u2019s impossible for me to know. If the answer to that could be found in the shallow wisdoms of a kid, wars would have stopped long ago. But I also dislike just leaving that problem up to society or the government. After all, a great person is just one who follows the popular will of the people. In this world, the essence of a frank honest human is just an idealization. I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s nothing that can make everyone happy. Happiness is relative, and that\u2019s how people want it. Evil is also relative. Mothers can become demons when they do anything to protect their child. Yet it\u2019s usually seen as admirable. But when a person does anything for the country he loves, wars break out. Isn't it all the same thing? No matter how much a person pretends to be good and kind, he will still have negative aspects. But nobody really tries to notice that fact. Why is that? They all try to place the blame on others, and never even consider the possibility that they themselves may have played part in the problem. Just what the heck am I thinking? The world isn't going to change no matter what I think. Then what should I be doing? I don\u2019t really want to do anything. I don\u2019t want to order nor trouble anyone. That\u2019s just laziness, I guess. I don\u2019t go to school nor do I work and I've been wasting my time away since noon.

    "quote": "\"The important thing is to take part.\" Famous words spoken by Pierre de Fr\u00e9dy, Baron de Coubertin during a speech. However, this quote tends to be frequently misused and serves as kind of a threat to force participation. There are tons of wild-goose chases in this world, y'know. If the most important thing is to take part, then surely one could find meaning in not taking part as well. And if everything's worth experiencing, then there's little doubt that the feeling of not experiencing something is, in itself, worth experiencing. In fact, you could even call it a valuable experience to not experience something everyone else does.",

But on that night, I learned the value of some things can't be measured on a simple scale. My brother and I knew the laws of science, of Equivalent Exchange, that gain required sacrifice, that something had to be taken from us. But we thought there was nothing more we could lose.
